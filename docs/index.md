# Overview

cleacss is a thoughtfully designed CSS framework for developers who love writing CSS. Rather than abstracting away CSS or overwhelming you with utility classes, cleacss provides a solid foundation with essential defaults while empowering you to write your own custom styles. It leverages modern CSS features like custom properties, subgrid, and responsive sizing to create a lightweight yet powerful system.

## Installation

Use your prefered package manager to install the cleacss package, or just download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/moinframe/cleacss/releases).

```bash
  npm install cleacss
```

## Usage

When you're using a bundler like vite you can import the css file directly from the cleacss package in your javascript or css file.

### Javascript
```js
import "cleacss";
```

### CSS
```css
@import "cleacss";
```
